**chore(release): Kabel 1.0.6 release**
- Implemented the Apollo renderer, a renderer that tries to match the "sticky note" style of other blueprint interfaces.
- Added shadow FX to default renderer.
- Added background pattern system under wsSvg.grid, options in Kabel.inject for grid added as well.
- Created new /themes folder, created dark and classic (Default) themes, added theme options to inject.
- Fixed input boxes (comment, raw field) so that when you click at a specific point, the caret starts there.
- Decided that where you click within a comment input is where it should start editing at.
- Added wsSvg.dragState to store information about the current block being dragged.
- Cleaned up the Flyout class to break up large methods into multiple. This makes extensions easier.
